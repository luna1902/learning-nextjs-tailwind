## Introduction

This repository serves as a learning playground for Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It includes various examples and exercises that showcase how to utilize the powerful features of these tools. The project is designed to help me and others understand the core concepts of Next.js and Tailwind CSS while experimenting with different patterns and structures.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, offering a highly optimized web application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a fast and efficient way to style applications.

## Project Features

- **Dynamic Routing**: Implemented dynamic routing in Next.js to handle various pages efficiently.
- **API Routes**: Explored API routes in Next.js to create serverless functions.
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: Utilized Tailwind CSS to style the application, focusing on responsive design and custom themes.
- **SSR & SSG**: Experimented with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) for optimal performance.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Structured the application using reusable components to maintain clean and manageable code.

## Installation
